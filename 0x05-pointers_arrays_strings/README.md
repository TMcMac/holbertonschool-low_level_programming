This is the read me file for Holberton cohort 11 0x05-pointers_arrays_strings which took place on Feb 17th and 18th 2020.

1. 0-reset_to_98.c - Write a function that takes a pointer to an int as parameter and updates the value it points to to 98.

2. 1-swap.c - Write a function that swaps the values of two integers.

3. 2-strlen.c - Write a function that returns the length of a string.

4. 3-puts.c - Write a function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout.

5. 4-print_rev.c - Write a function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line.

6. 5-rev_string.c - Write a function that reverses a string.

7. 6-puts2.c - Write a function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line.

8. 7-puts_half.c - Write a function that prints half of a string, followed by a new line.

Prototype: void puts_half(char *str);
The function should print the second half of the string
If the number of characters is odd, the function should print the last n characters of the string, where n = (length_of_the_string - 1) / 2


9. 8-print_array.c - Write a function that prints n elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line.

Prototype: void print_array(int *a, int n);
where n is the number of elements of the array to be printed
Numbers must be separated by comma, followed by a space
The numbers should be displayed in the same order as they are stored in the array
You are allowed to use printf


10. 9-strcpy.c - Write a function that copies the string pointed to by src, including the terminating null byte (\0), to the buffer pointed to by dest.Return value: the pointer to dest
